This code comes from the Java documentation at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/datagrams/index.html.

The CodeJava people have also been so kind as to recover the actual files from the docs and put it all together at ihttps://www.codejava.net/java-se/networking/java-udp-client-server-program-example.

I also like having things organized as a proper Java project. Coming soon.
